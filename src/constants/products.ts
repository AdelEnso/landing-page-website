We can potentially prevent MITM (Man-in-The-Middle) attacks by preventing directory structure changes as the structure itself is fragmented and randomized into multiple parts at the time when the communication session takes place - once the session is finished the structure returns to its original form.",

Even if infiltrated, decoding acquired codes to reveal the partial seeds from entropy sources is a complex mathematical task. This provides an additional layer of security in secure data communications and storage. Our system can be provided RNG-as-a-Service, or deployed as a software footprint to computing systems hardware. It can be customized depending on the target solution.",
