This is due to the necessity of finding the perfect blend of components. To aid in this process, computer simulations are often employed to understand issues such as drug resistance and treatment efficacy. Furthermore, in genetic research, scientists frequently map complete human genomes using an expensive but effective method known as long-read technology.",
